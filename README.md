Structure
=========

The structure is decomposed into computation models and data directories.

Computation Modules
-------------------

`solution.py` Main module for learning from a training data and classifying test data.

`bleach.py` Module for cleaning feature vectors


Data Directories
----------------

`data` Contains input data such as `train.csv` and `test.csv`

`results` Contains output data such as the classifications of survival of the `test.csv` generated by `solution.py`
